/* This Operatoroverloadng.java is made to read and analyse concept only and not to run this example. */

/* 1:-Java does not support user-defined operator overloading. While it does have a limited form of operator 
overloading for the + operator,this behavior is specific to string concatenation.

2:-The only form of operator overloading in Java is related to string concatenation using the + operator.

3:-When you use + with strings, Java either performs compile-time concatenation of constants or execution-time 
concatenation using StringBuilder or StringBuffer.

4:- java OPERATOR OVERLOADING support nhi krta h,kyuki language creators dwara ye design decision liye gya,
    taki operators ka mis-use na kia jaye overload kr k.
